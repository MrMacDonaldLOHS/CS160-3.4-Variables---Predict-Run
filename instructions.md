# Task - Predict and Run

Study the code carefully, and predict what the output of each print statement will be after the comment is removed. The first one has been done for you.



Your answers should be added to the code as comments. **As always, you will not be graded on the accuracy of your predictions!** You learn by making mistakes, and you are _expected_ to make them.

After you have made your predictions, remove the comments from the prints to see if you are correct.

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- The string text is surrounded by speech marks.
- The + and variable identifiers are **not** surrounded by speech marks
